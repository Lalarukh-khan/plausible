# Changelog

## v0.8.0

* Add support for Elixir 1.11, 1.12, and 1.13. Drop support for Elixir 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10. Elixir >= 1.11 is now required. Dropping support for older versions of Elixir simply means that this package is no longer tested with them in CI, and that compatibility issues are not considered bugs.
* Drop support for Erlang/OTP 20 and 21, and Erlang/OTP >= 22 is now required. Dropping support for older versions of Erlang/OTP simply means that this package is not tested with them in CI, and that compatibility issues are not considered bugs.
* In the Flag index page, for each flag, always display the gates in a consistent order. Previously the order depended on how the data was returned by the persistent datastore. (Thanks [LostKobrakai](https://github.com/LostKobrakai), [pull/16](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags_ui/pull/16))
* Require more recent versions of runtime dependencies.
* Local dev: added `credo` to CI setup.

## v0.7.2

* Also include a non-gzipped version of the Bootstrap CSS file, so that applications can still serve it when the pre-gzipped file is not supported. This was a problem in some setups where a reverse proxy would interfere with the browser requests for the CSS file, for example by setting a consertative `Accept-Enconding` request header.

## v0.7.1

* Relax `fun_with_flags` version constraint to `~> 1.1`

## v0.7.0

* Require `fun_with_flags 1.1.0`.
* Drop support for Elixir 1.4 and 1.5. Elixir >= 1.6 is now required.
* Drop support for OTP 19. OTP >= 20 is now required.

## v0.6.0

* Fixed issue with CSRF protextion blocking GET requests for the library's JS file. (Thanks [aturkewi](https://github.com/aturkewi), [pull/6](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags_ui/pull/6))
* API change: now there is no need to declare `Plug.CSRFProtection` or `protect_from_forgery` in the host plug or phoenix router because this library's router handles it internally.
* The mouse cursor now looks like a pointer when hovering buttons.
* Allow to depend on Cowboy 2.

## v0.5.0

(Thanks [aturkewi](https://github.com/aturkewi), [pull/4](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags_ui/pull/4))

## v0.4.1

* Remove compile-time call to `Application.ensure_started` that was causing noisy warning during compilation. (Thanks [Gazler](https://github.com/Gazler), [pull/2](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags_ui/pull/2))
