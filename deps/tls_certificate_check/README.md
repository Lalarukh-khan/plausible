`tls_certificate_check` is a library for Erlang/OTP and Elixir intended
on easing the establishement of [more
secure](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=CA/IncludedCertificates&redirect=no)
HTTPS connections in ordinary setups.

Other kinds of TLS/SSL connections may also benefit from it.

It wraps [Mozilla's CA certificate
store](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html), as extracted by `curl`,
together with
[ssl\_verify\_fun](https://github.com/deadtrickster/ssl_verify_fun.erl)
plus all the the boilerplate code required for validating [misordered
certificate chains](https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint/issues/95).

The trusted authorities' certificates are hardcoded in PEM format,
decoded when the application starts and made available to the API
through
[`persistent_term`](https://erlang.org/doc/man/persistent_term.html).

### Usage - Erlang

##### 1\. Import as a dependency

rebar.config

``` erlang
{deps,
 [% [...]
  {tls_certificate_check, "~> 1.14"}
  ]}.
```

your\_application.app.src

``` erlang
  {applications,
   [kernel,
    stdlib,
    % [...]
    tls_certificate_check
   ]}
```

##### 2\. Make your connections safer

``` erlang
Host = "example.com",
Options = tls_certificate_check:options(Host),
ssl:connect(Host, 443, Options, 5000)
```

### Usage - Elixir

##### 1\. Import as a dependency

mix.exs

``` elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      # [...]
      {:tls_certificate_check, "~> 1.14"}
    ]
  end
```

##### 2\. Make your connections safer

``` elixir
host = "example.com"
options = :tls_certificate_check.options(host)
:ssl.connect(host, 443, options, 5000)
```

### API Reference
