Thanks for being a Plausible Analytics subscriber!
<br /><br />
This is a notice that your traffic has exceeded your subscription tier two months in a row. Congrats on all that traffic!
<br /><br />
In order to keep your stats running, we require you to upgrade your account to accommodate your new traffic levels. If you do not upgrade your account within the next 7 days, we will lock your stats and they won't be accessible.
<br /><br />
In the last billing cycle (<%= date_format(@last_cycle.first) %> to <%= date_format(@last_cycle.last) %>), your account has used <%= PlausibleWeb.StatsView.large_number_format(@usage) %> billable pageviews.
<%= if @suggested_plan == :enterprise do %>
This is more than our standard plans, so please reply back to this email to get a quote for your volume.
<% else %>
Based on that we recommend you select the <%= @suggested_plan[:volume] %>/mo plan.
<br /><br />
You can upgrade your subscription using our self-serve platform. The new charge will be prorated to reflect the amount you have already paid and the time until your current subscription is supposed to expire.
