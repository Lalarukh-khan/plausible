Thanks for exploring Plausible, a simple and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. Your free 30-day trial is ending <%= @day %>, but you can keep using Plausible by upgrading to a paid plan.
<br /><br />
In the last month, your account has used <%= PlausibleWeb.AuthView.delimit_integer(@usage) %> billable pageviews<%= if @custom_events > 0, do: " and custom events in total", else: "" %>.
<%= if @usage <= 10_000_000 do %>
Based on that we recommend you select the <%= @suggested_plan[:volume] %>/mo plan.
<br /><br />
<%= link("Upgrade now", to: "#{plausible_url()}/billing/upgrade") %>
